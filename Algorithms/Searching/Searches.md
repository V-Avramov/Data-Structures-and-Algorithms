LinearSearch
-Worst case complexety O(n)
-It is more intuitive.It goes through every element until it reaches it's target.

BinarySearch
-Worst case complexety O(log(n))
-Usable only on sorted array(list,stack...)!!!
-It goes about by using the divide and conquer technique

TernarySearch
(same as Binary Search)

JumpSearch
-Worst case complexety O(sqrt(n))
-Usable only on sorted array(list,stack...)!!!
